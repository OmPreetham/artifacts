# artifacts

a collection of charming 3d clay‑style icons featuring everyday objects, inspired by ghibli and airbnb style. designed for modern web interfaces.

## about

the artifacts collection distills everyday objects into charming, 3‑d clay‑style icons. each piece features:

* hand‑molded look – softly rounded forms and puffed proportions evoke miniature polymer sculptures.
* matte‑satin finish – a gentle surface sheen adds depth without harsh reflections.
* minimal seams, rich detail – simplified silhouettes—yet accented with stripes, roof racks, or spoilers—strike the balance between clarity and character.
* unified lighting – subtle ambient occlusion and a soft drop shadow ground every icon while preserving a 100% transparent background for effortless layering.
* consistent scale – tiny, tucked wheels and proportional embellishments keep the set visually cohesive across vehicles, tools, food, and more.

designed for modern web interfaces, these icons drop seamlessly into dark or light themes, hero banners, or micro‑interactions—instantly adding warmth, playfulness, and a handcrafted touch to your product.
